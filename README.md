## ðŸ“œ Project Description

The goal of **AREA** was to **recreate the core concept of Zapier**, an automation platform that connects various services and APIs to automate tasks and workflows.  

Our project implements a system where:
- Users can connect to multiple services (e.g., Google, GitHub, etc.).
- Define **"Actions"** (triggers) and **"Reactions"** (responses).
- Automate workflows such as *"When an event happens in Service A, perform an action in Service B."*

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **User Authentication** â€“ Secure login and service integration.  
- **Service Connections** â€“ Connect to popular services via APIs (Google, GitHub, etc.).  
- **Action/Reaction Model** â€“ Inspired by Zapierâ€™s trigger-action pattern.  
- **Workflow Automation** â€“ Create custom automations between services.  
- **Web & Mobile Interface** â€“ Manage automations from the web dashboard or mobile app.
